# About DO PET BOT
This script makes your spaceship navigate over any DarkOrbit map you put it one.
While it does so you may let your PET collect loot.

You need the [botfather.io](https://botfather.io) client to run this bot script.
I made this script in my free time just to checkout what can be done with botfather.
Doing so I already discovered some bugs and made feature request to their dev team.
Feel free to check this code out to learn how their software work. Cheers
